# ðŸ”§ Security Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… **ALL RECOMMENDED FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Summary

All security issues identified in the comprehensive audit have been addressed. The application now includes enterprise-grade security controls.

---

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Explicit CORS Configuration
**Issue:** No explicit CORS policy  
**Fix:** Added configurable CORS middleware

**Changes:**
- Added `cors` package
- Configured CORS with environment variable support
- Allowed methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- Credentials enabled for authenticated requests
- 24-hour preflight cache

**Configuration:**
```typescript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(",") || 
    ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  maxAge: 86400, // 24 hours
};
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

**Environment Variable:**
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

---

### 2. âœ… Reduced Input Size Limits
**Issue:** 50MB body parser limit could enable DoS attacks  
**Fix:** Reduced to 10MB

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: limit: "50mb"
// After: limit: "10mb"
app.use(express.json({ limit: "10mb" }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ limit: "10mb", extended: true }));
```

**Impact:** Prevents large payload DoS attacks while maintaining functionality

---

### 3. âœ… Request Logging & Monitoring
**Issue:** No request logging for security monitoring  
**Fix:** Added Morgan HTTP request logger

**Changes:**
- Added `morgan` package
- Configured format based on environment:
  - Production: "combined" format (detailed)
  - Development: "dev" format (concise)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const morganFormat = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "combined" : "dev";
app.use(morgan(morganFormat));
```

**Benefits:**
- Track all HTTP requests
- Monitor suspicious patterns
- Audit trail for security incidents
- Performance monitoring

---

### 4. âœ… Content Security Policy Headers
**Issue:** No CSP headers configured  
**Fix:** Added comprehensive CSP via Helmet

**Changes:**
```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "data:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.manus.im", "https://login.manus.im"],
      frameSrc: ["'none'"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true,
  },
  referrerPolicy: { policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
  noSniff: true,
  xssFilter: true,
  frameguard: { action: "deny" },
}));
```

**Security Headers Added:**
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

---

### 5. âœ… Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
**Issue:** No security contact information  
**Fix:** Added security.txt file

**File:** `public/.well-known/security.txt`

**Contents:**
- Security contact email
- Vulnerability reporting guidelines
- Response timeline
- Supported versions
- Security practices documentation

**Access:** `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/security.txt`

---

### 6. âœ… Dependency Updates
**Issue:** 2 moderate vulnerabilities in dependencies  
**Fix:** Updated vitest to 4.0.3

**Results:**
- Reduced vulnerabilities from 2 to 1
- Remaining vulnerability is in drizzle-kit's transitive dependency
- Development-only, not in production build
- Waiting for drizzle-kit to update @esbuild-kit

## Security Improvements Summary

| Area | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| CORS | Not configured | Explicit whitelist | âœ… |
| Input Limits | 50MB | 10MB | âœ… |
| Logging | None | Morgan + Combined format | âœ… |
| CSP Headers | None | Comprehensive policy | âœ… |
| Disclosure | None | security.txt | âœ… |
| Vulnerabilities | 2 moderate | 1 dev-only | âœ… |

---

## New Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "cors": "2.8.5",
  "morgan": "1.10.1"
}
```

**Note:** `helmet` and `express-rate-limit` were already added in previous fixes.

---

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# CORS Configuration (comma-separated list of allowed origins)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

# Request logging format (set in production)
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## Testing the Fixes

### Test CORS
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
  -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/api/trpc
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Look for: Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
```

### Test Request Logging
```bash
# Check console output for Morgan logs
curl http://localhost:3000/api/trpc/articles.list
```
